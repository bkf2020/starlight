# starlight problem solving

https://starlightps.org

Starlight problem solving is a platform where users can post hints and insights for over 20,000 competitive programming
and math problems. Users can see summaries of hints/insights for inspiration and find similar problems given insight(s) of
a problem they struggled on.

In the future, we hope to implement an AI to predict the key insights/observations needed to solve a problem, and an AI to summarize
the key insights/observations needed to succeed to a certain level in competitive programming (e.g. solving USACO gold problems).
